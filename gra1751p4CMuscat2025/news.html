<h2 id="title2">Playboi Carti And Travis Scott Deliver An Instant Classic With "Crush"
</h2>
<p id="article2">Travis Scott makes a major impact on Playboi Carti’s new album, MUSIC, which dropped on Friday. The 30-track project features a range of sounds, but Scott’s presence is one of the biggest highlights. He appears early on the album with CRUSH, a song that was previously teased on Instagram. The track builds with hypnotic synths before Scott helps drive it to an explosive beat drop, setting the stage for Carti’s deep-toned verse. As Carti pushes his sound in a new direction, Scott’s signature energy elevates the track, proving once again why he remains one of hip-hop’s most influential artists.</p>
